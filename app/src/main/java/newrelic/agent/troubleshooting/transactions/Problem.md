# Problem

For each transaction answer the following questions:

- How many transactions are created?
- How many transaction activities are created?
- Is this the proper way to use our API?
- What will the transaction shape look like (parenting)?

To check your answers, run the Runner class which will loop infinitely
and create a transaction each loop.
